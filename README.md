- ‚úÖ **Official Norges Bank USD/NOK exchange rates** 
- ‚úÖ **Transaction grouping** to minimize Kryptosekken processing costs (94.7% reduction in my use case*)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

While it has been extensively tested and follows Norwegian tax regulations, cryptocurrency tax rules are complex and subject to interpretation. 

**You are responsible for:**
- Verifying all transaction categorizations are correct for your situation
- Reviewing all output files before submitting to tax authorities
- Ensuring compliance with current Norwegian tax laws

**Always review the generated files carefully before using them for tax reporting.**

### Exchange Rate Data

**Required**: The tool requires USD/NOK exchange rate data from Norges Bank to function correctly.

1. **Download historical exchange rates from Norges Bank**:
   - Visit: https://app.norges-bank.no/query/index.html#/no/currency
   - Select Currency: `USD`
   - Select Frequency: `Business days (B)` 
   - Set date range covering your transaction period
   - Download the CSV file (typically named `EXR.csv`)
   - Place it in the `data/` folder

2. **Example URL for 2024-2025 data**:
   ```
   https://app.norges-bank.no/query/index.html#/no/currency?currency=USD&frequency=B&startdate=2024-08-17&stopdate=2025-08-17
   ```

**Note**: The tool does not automatically fetch exchange rates online. You must download the `EXR.csv` file manually and place it in the `data/` folder before processing transactions.

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced use cases, you can modify:
- `src/operation_mapper.py` - Transaction type mappings
- `src/currency_converter.py` - Exchange rate handling
- `src/transaction_grouper.py` - Grouping logic

## Data Privacy & Security

- **No data leaves your computer** - All processing is done locally

- No personal information is transmitted
- All intermediate files are saved locally for your review

## Norwegian Tax Information
